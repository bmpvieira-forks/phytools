\title{Threshold model using Bayesian MCMC}
\usage{
threshBayes(tree, X, types=NULL, ngen=1000, control=list())
}
\arguments{
  \item{tree}{an object of class \code{"phylo"}.}
  \item{X}{a numeric matrix containing values for a numerically coded discrete character and a continuous character; or two discrete characters. The row names of \code{X} should be species names.}
  \item{types}{a vector of length \code{ncol(X)} containing the data types for each column of \code{X}, for instance \code{c("discrete","continuous")}.}
  \item{ngen}{a integer indicating the number of generations for the MCMC.}
  \item{control}{a list of control parameters for the MCMC. Control parameters include: \code{sample}, the sampling interval for the MCMC; \code{propvar}, a vector containing (in this order) proposal variances for the two rates (if the type is \code{"discrete"} this will be ignored), the two ancestral states, and the correlation; \code{propliab}, a single proposal variance for the liabilities; \code{pr.mean}, a vector for the mean of the prior probability distributions for each parameter, in the same order as \code{propvar}; \code{pr.liab}, currently ignored; \code{pr.var}, a vector with variances for the prior densities for each parameter, in the same order as \code{pr.mean} - note that for the rates we use an exponential distribution so the first two means are currently ignored; and \code{pr.vliab} currently ignored.}

\description{
  This function uses Bayesian MCMC to fit the quantitative genetics threshold model (Felsenstein 2012) to data for two discrete characters or one discrete and one continuous character.
}
\value{
  This function returns a list with two elements: \code{par} a matrix containing the posterior sample for the model parameters (evolutionary rates, ancestral states, and correlation); \code{liab} a matrix containing the posterior sample of the liabilities. For continuous characters, the liabilities are treated as known and so the posterior samples are just the observed values.
